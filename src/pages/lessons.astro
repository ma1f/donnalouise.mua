      <blockquote>“I would highly recommend Donna Louise MUA for her professional lessons in understanding the best way to apply and use makeup on maturing skin.  My skin was very dry and is now looking glowing and radiant.<br/>In particular Donna helped me to obtain a more up to date and modern application of makeup.  The foundation match is perfect and range of lipsticks looks great on my skin tone and my blusher is now very uplifting.  My makeup has never felt so good and I now feel confident in applying it.”</blockquote>
